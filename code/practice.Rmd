Rmd script that loads the data file, selects all the data for Albania+Afghanistan+Angola, and makes three scatter plots (one for each country) that each have year on the x-axis and GDP on the y-axis. Describe any trends you see for each country using markdown text.

```{r}

subset()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
